# Handburger's STQ Reader Tool

**Handburger's STQ Reader Tool** is a Python-based application designed to analyze and read `.stqr` files, providing a comprehensive interface for examining hexadecimal data. This tool is particularly useful for those working with audio files and data within the `.stqr` format, offering easy-to-use functionality to inspect and manage hex data, with features such as pattern recognition and flexible grid views.

## Features

- **Hexadecimal Viewer**: Display and inspect raw hex data from `.stqr` files in an organized and readable format.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Automatically detect and process specific data patterns within the hex content, such as sound file references and metadata.
- **Interactive Data Grid**: Visualize parsed data in a table format with resizable and auto-adjusting headers.
- **Random Easter Egg**: 20% chance of displaying an `egg.png` image upon loading a file, adding a bit of fun to your work.
- **Theming**: Toggle between dark and light modes for better readability depending on your preference.
- **Customizable Interface**: Adjust header sizes, and the application automatically spaces out headers to ensure they are legible on startup.
- **Dynamic App Title**: The application title dynamically updates to include the currently loaded file, making it easy to keep track of your work.
