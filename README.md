# Handburger's MHGU Mod Platform (Hand_Modkit)

## Overview

My MHGU Mod Platform, also known as Hand_Modkit, is a comprehensive tool designed for modding Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate (MHGU). This platform integrates multiple tools into a single, user-friendly application, allowing users to easily modify and customize their game files.

### Featured Plugins

- **STQ Tool**: Edit and manage .opus STQR files with an intuitive hex editor.
- **Opus Header Injector**: Modify and inject headers into headerless OPUS audio files.
- **FolderMaker** : Create a directory to the exact name of the file you want to replace.
- **Hex De/Encoder** : Convert from hexadecimal to little Endian 32-bit signed integer and Windows ANSI.
- **Audio Calculator**: Convert between audio samples and duration in MM:SS.s format, with support for high-precision calculations. (For Opus Header Injector)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyQt5
- Decimal module (included in Python's standard library)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Hand_Modkit.git
    cd Hand_Modkit
    ```

2. **Install the required Python packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

   **Note**: If a `requirements.txt` file is not available, you can manually install `PyQt5`:
    ```bash
    pip install PyQt5
    ```

3. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python Hb_Modkit.py
    ```

### Usage

- **STQ Tool**: Open, view, and edit STQR files. Use the hex editor to directly modify file contents in the grid.
- **Opus Header Injector**: Load OPUS files, modify their headers, and save the changes. Preview the header modifications before saving.
- **Audio Calculator**: Convert audio samples to duration and vice versa. Enter duration in `MM:SS.s` format for accurate sample calculations.

### Hotkeys

- **Increase Font Size**: `Ctrl +`
- **Decrease Font Size**: `Ctrl -`
