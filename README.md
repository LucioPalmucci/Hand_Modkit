## Future Features

I'm working to improve Hand_Modkit and expand its capabilities. Here's a glimpse of what's coming in future updates:

- STQR Conflict Manager: Fixes multi-mod conflicts of the stqr files.
- Audio to MCA Converter: A tool to convert various audio formats directly to MCA, simplifying the audio modding process.
- MCA Header Injector/Editor: An advanced tool for injecting and editing headers in MCA files, allowing for more detailed control over audio modifications.
- Kuriimu2 Compatibility: Integration with Kuriimu2, including support for .dll files, opening .arc files, and editing .tex files. This will enhance Hand_Modkit's versatility and allow seamless editing of game assets.
- Compile into Full Exe: The goal is to compile Hand_Modkit into a standalone executable, making it easier to distribute and use without requiring a Python environment.
- Better GUI for Easier Use: We're working on refining the graphical user interface to make it more intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring that even new users can navigate and use the tool effectively.

Stay tuned for these updates!
