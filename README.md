# Handburger's Modkit

Hand_Modkit, also known as Handburger's Modkit or H.Modkit, is a versatile multi-use tool designed for modding *Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate* (MHGU). With a suite of specialized utilities, this toolkit gives modders tools to easily edit, analyze, and manage various game files. Whether you're injecting audio headers, calculating audio properties, or organizing mod folders, Hand_Modkit simplifies the complex tasks involved in MHGU modding.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12.x**: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **PyQt5**: Install PyQt5, the library used for the GUI. You can install it via pip:
  \`\`\`bash
  pip install PyQt5
  \`\`\`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/RTHKKona/Hand_Modkit.git
   \`\`\`
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   \`\`\`bash
   cd Hand_Modkit
   \`\`\`
3. Open up \`Hb_Modkit.py\` or any standalone Python script in \`/scripts/\`.

## Future Features

I'm working to improve Hand_Modkit and expand its capabilities. Here's a glimpse of what's coming in future updates:

- **Kuriimu2 Compatibility**: Integration with Kuriimu2, including support for \`.dll\` files, opening \`.arc\` files, and editing \`.tex\` files. This will enhance Hand_Modkit's versatility and allow seamless editing of game assets.
- **Compile into Full Exe**: The goal is to compile Hand_Modkit into a standalone executable, making it easier to distribute and use without requiring a Python environment.
- **Better GUI for Easier Use**: We're working on refining the graphical user interface to make it more intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring that even new users can navigate and use the tool effectively.

Stay tuned for these updates!
