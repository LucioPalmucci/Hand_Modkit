## General Guidelines

1. **Follow Python Best Practices**: Ensure that your code is clean, well-documented, and adheres to Python best practices, including PEP 8 for styling.
2. **Keep Dependencies Minimal**: Avoid introducing unnecessary dependencies. If a new dependency is required, justify its inclusion and add it to the `requirements.txt` file.
3. **Testing**: Thoroughly test your script to ensure it integrates smoothly with the existing tabs and does not introduce bugs or regressions.

## Creating a New Python Script Tab

To create a new tab within the Handburger Modkit:

1. **Create Your Script**: Develop your Python script as a class that extends `QWidget` or another appropriate PyQt5 base class. The script should encapsulate its functionality and be self-contained.

2. **Tab Integration**: 
   - Place your script in the `scripts/` directory.
   - Update the `HbModkit` class in the main application to import your script.
   - Add an entry in the `add_tabs` method within `HbModkit` to include your new script as a tab. The tab should be labeled appropriately based on its functionality.

3. **Error Handling**: Implement appropriate error handling within your script to ensure that any issues do not crash the main application.

## Updating the About Page

Once your script is added, update the About page with the following steps:

1. **Modify the AboutTab Class**: 
   - Navigate to the `AboutTab` class in the main application.
   - Add a new entry to the `self.tools` dictionary that includes the name of your script and a brief description of its functionality.

2. **Ensure Proper Formatting**: The About page uses HTML for content display. Make sure your new entry is correctly formatted in HTML.

3. **Testing the Update**: After updating the About page, run the application to ensure that your new tab and its description appear correctly in the About section.

## Submitting Your Contribution

Once youâ€™ve made your changes:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a fork of the repository on GitHub.
2. **Create a New Branch**: Work on your changes in a new branch named descriptively (e.g., `feature-new-tab`).
3. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once your changes are complete, submit a pull request (PR) with a clear and detailed description of what your contribution adds or modifies.
4. **Address Feedback**: Be prepared to engage in the PR review process. Address any feedback provided by maintainers to ensure your contribution meets project standards.
